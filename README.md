## Description
Notion-To-Calendar is a tool designed to synchronize Notion pages with Google calendar. It automates the process of transferring your scheduled tasks from a Notion taskboard/list to Google calendar using [Notion integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar?hl=de).


## Requirements
- Node.js installed on your system.
- A Notion account and API key.
- Google Cloud setup (go to: Google Cloud Setup Instructions)

## Installation
To get started with Notion-To-Calendar, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Branchenprimus/Notion-To-Calendar.git
```

## Setup
1. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd Notion-To-Calendar
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Notion API key:
   ```env
   NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key_here
   NOTION_DB_ID=your_notion_db_id_here
   ```

4. To start the application, type:

   `npm run start` compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript and runs the index.js file.

   `npm run test` cleans temporary files and the Google Calendar token, compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript, and then runs the index.js.


## Notion Integration Setup
1. Generate an [integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) token from your Notion account.
2. Share the Notion page or database with your integration.
3. Use the Notion API key (integration token) in the `.env` file as mentioned in the setup.

## Google Cloud Setup Instructions

Complete this [quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/nodejs) to set up your environment or refer to: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) & [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar?hl=de).

## Data Model

The `UnifiedEventData` interface is central to the Notion-To-Calendar application, encapsulating the data structure for calendar events. This unified model is used for synchronizing event information between Notion and other calendar services. Each field in the interface is described below:

- ***id (string):** A unique identifier, automatically generated by Notion.*
- **taskName (string):** The name or title of the event. This is a brief description of the event or task.
- **status (string):** The current status of the event (e.g., "Not started", "In Progress", "Completed"). It helps in tracking the progress of tasks.
- **start (Date, optional):** Specifies the starting date and time of the event. This field is optional; if not provided, the event's start time is considered unspecified.
- **end (Date, optional):** Represents the ending date and time of the event. Similar to start, this field is optional and may be omitted if the event's end time is not defined.
- **priority (string):** The priority level of the event (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low", "No Priority"). This is used to categorize events based on their importance.
- **content (string, optional):** Contains additional details or content related to the event. This could include extended descriptions, notes, or other relevant information. This field is optional and can be used to store any supplementary data associated with the event.



An example of a `UnifiedEventData` object is as follows:

```json
{
  "id": "8e9e2d3a-e5a5-4554-898a-e4b51b2ba284",
  "taskName": "Test Event",
  "status": "Not started",
  "start": "2024-01-27T00:00:00.000Z",
  "end": "2024-01-27T00:00:00.000Z",
  "priority": "No Priority",
  "content": "Additional details here"
}
```
